# Project Analysis Findings

## 1. Documentation Issues

- Empty author field in package.json
- README.md likely lacks detailed documentation
- TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md content unknown but may be incomplete

## 2. Testing Concerns

- Unclear test coverage from scripts (test:all runs test-runner.js but needs verification)
- Test files (test-mcp.js, test-edge-cases.js) may not cover all scenarios
- No clear indication of test coverage metrics

## 3. CLI Implementation

- Uses yargs but potential for better argument validation
- Two CLI commands defined (jsx-analyzer and my-component-prop-analyzer) which might be confusing

## 4. MCP Server Integration

- MCP server implementation in mcp-server.js needs verification
- Potential issues with tool/resource definitions and handling

## 5. AST Parsing

- Babel parser configuration might miss edge cases in JSX parsing
- No indication of support for different JSX pragma/transformations

## 6. Schema Validation

- Zod schema implementation for prop validation needs verification
- Potential for unhandled schema validation errors

## 7. Error Handling

- Unclear how errors are handled in the analyzer
- No indication of robust error recovery mechanisms
